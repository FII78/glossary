A load balancer is a crucial component in computer networks that distributes incoming requests across multiple servers. By doing so, it prevents any single server from becoming overwhelmed, ensuring consistent and reliable performance for users accessing websites or applications.

## Problem it addresses

Managing network traffic distribution across multiple servers or instances is a complex task, particularly in large-scale applications. Without an automated solution, maintaining high availability, efficient resource utilization, and seamless [scaling](https://github.com/ronitblenz/glossary/blob/cloud_computing/content/en/scalability.md) becomes challenging. Load balancers address this problem by automating the distribution of incoming requests, ensuring [reliability](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/content/en/reliability.md), and enhancing system performance.

## How it helps

Load balancers enable users to define the desired state of a system. Initially, they specify the systemâ€™s configuration (e.g., number of servers, pods, etc.). Subsequently, the load balancer continuously monitors the infrastructure and automatically corrects any deviations from the intended state (e.g., by spinning up new servers if one fails). This streamlined automation simplifies critical operational tasks, including provisioning, deployment, scaling, networking, and load balancing, which would otherwise be labor-intensive and intricate for engineering teams.
